      <description>In my previous post about setting up a Kubernetes cluster using Fedora CoreOS nodes I mentioned the fact that SELinux should not be disabled when creating Kubernetes clusters.</description>

      <title>Creating a Kubernetes Cluster with Fedora CoreOS 36</title>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how to create a Kubernetes 1.24 cluster on Fedora CoreOS 36 nodes.
I will assume that, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you already know that Fedora CoreOS is a great choice as a Kubernetes node OS because of both the ease of maintenance provided by RPM-OSTree and Zincati and the really easy way to automate provisioning of new nodes thanks to the use of Butane and Ignition.</description>

      <description>Long time no see! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve last posted something on my blog, and that&amp;rsquo;s been for several reasons, with the bottom line being that I&amp;rsquo;ve run out of ideas and haven&amp;rsquo;t really had the time to sit down and think about great blog post ideas.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote a post about how to implement JWT Authorization in Flutter apps. I only considered the use case of writing a mobile app, so I recommended the use of the flutter_secure_storage package to store the tokens.</description>

      <description>We are going to discuss how to display notifications using the flutter_local_notifications plugin.
As always with these posts, you can be sure you&amp;rsquo;ve got all of the basic knowledge you need by reading my Flutter book, but not all of you like that way of learning, so I&amp;rsquo;ll list the topics which are considered prerequisites for this post.</description>

The series of posts about advanced networking topics applied to Flutter apps continues. As always, this is meant for people who already have a good understanding of Flutter and know how to use Flutter widgets and the basics of the http library.</description>

      <title>Advanced Flutter Networking Part 1: Uploading a File to a REST API from Flutter Using a Multi-Part (form-data) POST Request</title>

      <description>My Flutter book is pretty light on advanced HTTP networking topics, focusing instead on giving a more well-rounded approach that, when it comes to networking, explains how to use the http networking package for basic requests, shows an example of an app that makes GET requests, and then goes a bit more specific with Firebase.</description>

      <description>When you love new stuff but don&amp;rsquo;t really want to lose old stuff you write this kind of stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s about tech stuff that&amp;rsquo;s old and tech stuff that&amp;rsquo;s new.</description>

      <description>This post is the third out of four in a series of posts about automating everyday tasks using scripting languages. The first one was an introduction to the hypothetical problem of having to take images divided into subfolders and dump all of them in one folder while altering their name and adding text over them to know what folder they came from (hypotheticall revealing the location where the pictures were taken) to solve and a first simple solution using Bash and ImageMagick.</description>

      <description>In the previous post we saw how to use Bash to build a simple script that copies some pictures organized into subfolders into a single folder while renaming them and adding some text on them to make it possible for you to know where it was taken based on the folder the pictures were in.</description>
