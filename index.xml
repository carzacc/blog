As always with these posts, you can be sure you&amp;rsquo;ve got all of the basic knowledge you need by reading my Flutter book, but not all of you like that way of learning, so I&amp;rsquo;ll list the topics which are considered prerequisites for this post.</description>

      <description>My Flutter book is pretty light on advanced HTTP networking topics, focusing instead on giving a more well-rounded approach that, when it comes to networking, explains how to use the http networking package for basic requests, shows an example of an app that makes GET requests, and then goes a bit more specific with Firebase.</description>

      <description>This post is the third out of four in a series of posts about automating everyday tasks using scripting languages. The first one was an introduction to the hypothetical problem of having to take images divided into subfolders and dump all of them in one folder while altering their name and adding text over them to know what folder they came from (hypotheticall revealing the location where the pictures were taken) to solve and a first simple solution using Bash and ImageMagick.</description>

      <description>In the previous post we saw how to use Bash to build a simple script that copies some pictures organized into subfolders into a single folder while renaming them and adding some text on them to make it possible for you to know where it was taken based on the folder the pictures were in.</description>
